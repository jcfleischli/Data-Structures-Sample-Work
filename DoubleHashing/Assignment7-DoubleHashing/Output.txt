*  ASSIGNMENT #7 : Double Hashing
**************************************************

Double Hashing:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| This program will create a map that holds integer keys and string values.
| Nodes containing keys and values will be inserted and removed throughout
| the runtime. The program will use a double hashing algorithm to place the
| nodes into the correct cell. If the cell is already taken the 2nd hash
| function will be used. If a matching key is passed in with a different value,
| the cell in which that key is located will have its value overwritten.
| When all the keys and values have been stored, the map will print in an
| organized table by column.
